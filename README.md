# unicorn-hourglass

I was in Rockville the other day and stopped by the Micro Center.
I found a neat gadget in the back:

I decided to make a digital hourglass using it. Starting at midnight
it does the following:

- Around every 30 seconds, a grain of sand is randomly dropped into the
matrix.
- At 30 minutes, the the matrix is full and then grains of sand randomly
drain out.
- At the hour, the matrix is empty and a blue hour marker is added
- Every five hours a red hour marker is added instead and it erases the
previous blue markers.
